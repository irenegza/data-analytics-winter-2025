# **AI Foundations Assignment: Evaluating ChatGPT as a Data Tutor**

## **Objective**  
This assignment aims to help students critically evaluate the effectiveness of using ChatGPT as a data tutor by analyzing its responses, comparing it to Google, and understanding when to use each resource for problem-solving. You will use your spreadsheet and pivot tables from your course pre-work to complete this assignment.

## **Instructions**

### 1. **Introduction**  
Write a short paragraph below describing the role of AI tools like ChatGPT in learning data analytics. Include your expectations for how ChatGPT can assist in your learning process.

***To me, the role of AI assisting in the learning process is invaluable. Focusing on Data Analytics, I consider it like a personal tutor to clarify doubts that I otherwise would have looked in the "manual for dummies". It is true that AI can provide answers to almost every question, but it must not supply the intention of true understanding and applying those concepts by ourselves. Using AI to learn data analytics will be helpful to answer doubts that would otherwise make me disconnect from the main purpose of the learning, for example, if I'm asking Chat GPT how to organize the data in a specific pattern or instruction, I am focusing on using that data in that particular pattern to learn something else related to data analytics, and if I didn't had Chat GPT to help me organize it, it would have deviated my focus point to learn a quick set up rather than the actual data focus. I intend to use it to help me organize my ideas and to quickly get out of the loop of finding the answer to a technology that I don't yet understand but it's keeping me away from the skill that is intended to originally. For example, I wanted to reply to this message with bold italic to differentiate from the markdown, and I asked Chat GPT how to do it without investing more time into it. I ***

### 2. **Data Task: Sorting in Pivot Charts**  

You will ask ChatGPT the following question:  
**_"How do you sort the values in a pivot chart by descending order in Excel?"_** (or Google Sheets if that is what you are using) 

- **a. Ask ChatGPT:**  
  - Screenshot ChatGPT's response and include below. 
  - Implement the instructions provided by ChatGPT in Excel or Google Sheets to test if they work.

- **b. Analysis:**  
  - Evaluate the response: Was the explanation clear? Did the steps work? Were there any errors or missing steps?
  - ***I am a very OCD person, and the instructions provided felt right, but the fact that it mentioned: locate the dropdown next to the field name, is not correct, its underneath the name, made me rethink the instructions.
  - Suggest how the explanation could be improved, if necessary.
  - ***My suggestion would be to include a visual of some sort. either an image or a video.

### 3. **Comparison**  
- Use Google to search for the same solution (e.g., "sort pivot chart by descending order in Excel").  
- Compare the Google search experience to ChatGPT’s response:  
  - Was the Google result more or less detailed?
  - ***The AI Overview was kind of the same as Chat GPT. The components next to it where the ones that made me feel more confident in using them. The video suggestions and the tutorials seemed to be more personalized.
  - Did you find videos, articles, or blog posts helpful?
  - ***Yes. They transmitted the sense of it being knowledge proven by other person and not a machine, and made it a bit more trustful.
  - Include any relevant link(s) you found helpful and explain why.
  - *** I am attaching the following picture:
  - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8ac180d-c863-47b8-b38a-b90a12171108)
  - *** As a visual learner I appreciate the visual representation and guidance. ALso the segregation according to moments in the video is very helpful to come back to check.

### 4. **Pick Another Scenario*  
- Ask ChatGPT another data question as it relates to how to do something in excel/google sheets 
- Which resource you found most effective for this?
  ***In terms of data analytics strictly, I think Chat GPT is more helpful because I can be really direct and REDIRECT the computer to where I want to go and obtain my answers, which with Google search I haven't had that sense of deepening up in a particular topic. I do like more the sensation of using the resources from Google search because I know they come from another human brain that typed it, but I need to recognize that Chat GPT is way more manageable. Also, I need to remember that Chat GPT uses multiple data sets from those Google searches, so it's the same but improved or tailored to my needs.

### 5. **When to Use Which Resource**  
Write a short response below explaining when it would be appropriate to use ChatGPT or Google. Consider factors like:  
- Time sensitivity  
- Complexity of the problem  
- Need for detailed visual instructions  
- Level of confidence in verifying the accuracy of the information  

---

### 6. **Final Reflection**  
Reflect on your experience using ChatGPT vs Google and describe:  
- Which resource you found most effective for this task and why.  
- How this exercise influenced your approach to learning new data skills in the future.
