# The AI Frontier

Welcome, y’all, to this data game,  
Where AI’s the future, and we stake our claim.  
The race is on, the stakes are high,  
Who owns the data will touch the sky.  

Three types of players, I’ve seen them all—  
Some lean in, standing proud and tall.  
Some dabble a bit, unsure of the plan,  
And some sit back, afraid to take a stand.  

But let me tell you, don’t fear the shift,  
AI’s a tool, your ultimate gift.  
It’s not the machine that’ll take your role,  
It’s the person who learns it, who’s in control.  

I see OCR turning notes to gold,  
Google Cloud Vision, the stories it’s told.  
From handwritten scribbles to clean CSVs,  
AI’s the bridge to possibilities.  

But let’s not forget the ethics at play,  
Biases lurking in the AI way.  
It’s our job to fight, to shape what’s right,  
To keep the future in a human light.  

Your data’s a map, a treasure untold,  
Visualize it wisely, let the insights unfold.  
Each line, each chart, each metric you find,  
Is a key to the questions that shape humankind.  

So here we stand, at the dawn of it all,  
Tech Moms rising, answering the call.  
The work we do isn’t just for today,  
It’s for the next generation, leading the way.  

Together we build, together we thrive,  
Harnessing AI to keep dreams alive.  
So lean in, learn, and take the wheel,  
This is your future—bold and real.
