# Drake’s Rap: “AI Foundations Flow”

:microphone: Verse 1:
 Welcome to the class, let’s vibe on the screen,
 AI foundations, we shaping the dream.
 Housekeeping done, agreements on deck,
 Cameras on, stay focused, show respect.
Breakout rooms, getting to know the crew,
 “How you use AI?” That’s the first Q.
 Some for emails, some just for fun,
 Stories with pictures—yeah, we getting it done.

:microphone: Chorus:
 AI’s a tutor, coach, and a guide,
 Helping us level up, no need to hide.
 From data cleaning to visions so clear,
 We the future, the tech pioneers.

:microphone: Verse 2:
 Teachers on board, crafting lesson plans,
 Chatbots assist, lending their hands.
 Bias in the models? That’s real talk,
 Feed it good data, let the AI walk.
Machine learning wild, clustering the vibe,
 Spotify and Netflix know what we like.
 From pie charts to bars, pick the best graph,
 Keep the visuals sharp, and the math won’t laugh.

:microphone: Bridge:
 Confidence building, no stress on the quiz,
 It’s all about learning, that’s how it is.
 Kelsey and Alyson, guiding the way,
 Tech Moms rising, it’s a brand-new day.

:microphone: Chorus:
 AI’s a tutor, coach, and a guide,
 Helping us level up, no need to hide.
 From data cleaning to visions so clear,
 We the future, the tech pioneers.

:microphone: Outro:
 Sal Khan said it, education can thrive,
 With AI as a partner, dreams come alive.
 So don’t fear the tech, let it light your path,
 Tech Moms in the building, we doing the math.
