# Data Dreams and Rising Stars

Welcome all, to this brave new start,
Where data meets with a learner’s heart.
From spreadsheets vast to SQL queries tight,
We’re shaping our futures, step into the light.

With laughter and stories, our mentors lead,
Sharing their journeys, planting a seed.
From payroll beginnings to tech-world acclaim,
Each shared success fuels our aim.

In GitHub’s code and analytic streams,
We’re crafting dashboards, chasing dreams.
Module by module, confidence grows,
Like seedlings nurtured, our knowledge flows.

Kelsey’s wisdom, a guiding flame,
Her story of grit reminds us: claim your name.
And Alyson, with her guiding hand,
Turns fear into courage—she helps us stand.

"Ask the questions!" the soapbox plea,
For every “what if” grows clarity.
Together we rise, no learner alone,
In every setback, resilience is shown.

The capstone awaits—a final quest,
To show the world our absolute best.
Dashboards for nonprofits, insights that gleam,
Proof that we’re more than just a dream.

So here’s to the work, the grit, and the grind,
To finding support when we’re in a bind.
For moms, mentors, and data fans true,
This class is a journey where dreams debut.
