Similar to a company's balance sheet, a net worth spreadsheet the value of your assets minus your liabilities. It provides a snapshot of your current financial picture and is useful in tracking your wealth along the way. This assignment guides you through how to gather your financial information in one place to calculate your net worth.

**Note:** Net worth does not equal self-worth! It is an optional bonus exercise for this class to practice data and financial literacy skills. 

Collect the following information on your Net Worth Spreadsheet to understand your full financial picture: 

* Liabilities (cash owed)
* Liquid cash savings (cash available)
* Non-income generating assets (cash held)
* Income generating assets (cash working)
* Your net worth (total assets - total liabilities)
* This spreadsheet includes examples in each category to help you capture everything.

**Estimated time to complete:** 1 hour

Time will vary depending on the number of accounts you have. It's not always easy to track down the fees associated with these accounts, so give yourself a minimum of one hour to complete. You can always fill it out in stages.
